# Eat-Da-Burger

## Overview

Eat-Da-Burger is an application that allows the user to devour burgers with the click of a button and add new burgers to their list of burgers to eat. It works through the use of GET, POST, and DELETE requests connected to a MySQL database. You can find the deployed site [here](https://afternoon-peak-49087.herokuapp.com/).
